# Fire Detection System

A computer visionâ€“based fire detection solution using a camera, designed for edge devices like Raspberry Pi. This project integrates with ESP32 for sending and reading data via Blynk, allowing real-time user notifications and remote monitoring.

## Features

- **CV Model for Fire Detection**: Utilizes a trained computer vision model to detect fire from live camera feeds.
- **ESP32 Integration**: Sends detection data and alerts using Blynk, enabling remote user notifications.
- **Raspberry Pi Deployment**: Optimized to run on Raspberry Pi for real-world applications.
- **Test Scripts**: Includes scripts for testing and verifying system functionality on Raspberry Pi.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (any modern version)
- ESP32 microcontroller
- Camera module compatible with Raspberry Pi
- Blynk account and app (for notifications)
- Python, OpenCV, and required libraries

### Setup

1. **Clone this repository:**
